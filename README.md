# REACT-CSS-Notation-Converter
This is a small plugin for Sublime Text 3 that converts CSS notation to and from its normal syntax to the DOM notation that is accessed by React. I made this to speed up React development due to the fact that CSS style objects can be created and stored within React components, but rewriting the CSS into React friendly, DOM notation was a hassle.

1. Create a folder in your sublime text packages directory. Name is not important.
2. Clone this repo's contents into that folder.
3. Highlight CSS and right click the selection. Select context menu item. I named mine React CSS because I mainly use this for React work. 

All context menu options can be rename with the Context.sublime-menu file.
